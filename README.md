# Data Lake Lab for TechCon 2023

## About the lab

This lab demonstrates integration of structured data in Cloud Storage into BigQuery with a minimum viable example of a CSV file containing Chicago crimes reference data into BigQuery from where we will run a crime trend report. The technology and product used to integrate are Apache Spark on Dataproc Serverless. We will use a readily available Dataproc (integration) template (quickstart/solution accelerator) for the integration that does not require code authoring, just integration configuration. 

This lab is intended to be a gentle introduction to Dataproc for the BigQuery savvy user base that aspire to ease into open data analytics on Google Cloud Platform.
