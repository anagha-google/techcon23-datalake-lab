# Data Lake Lab for TechCon 2023

## About the lab

This lab demonstrates integration of structured data in Cloud Storage into BigQuery with a minimum viable example of a CSV file containing Chicago crimes reference data into BigQuery from where we will run a crime trend report. The technology and product used to integrate are Apache Spark on Dataproc Serverless Batch. We will use a readily available Dataproc (integration) template (quickstart/solution accelerator) for the integration that does not require code authoring, just integration configuration. 

This lab is intended to be a gentle introduction to Dataproc for the BigQuery savvy user base that aspire to ease into open data analytics on Google Cloud Platform.

## About Dataproc Serverless Spark 

Dataproc Serverless Spark is a fully managed, autoscalable, zero ops, secure Spark as a service for data engineering and machine learning at scale. It offers a zero resource contention, democratized spark experience - accelerating developer productivity and speed to production. Learn more at - https://cloud.google.com/dataproc-serverless/docs 


## About Dataproc Templates

Dataproc templates is an Apache Spark based, code-free solution to execute simple, but large, cloud data tasks, including data import/export/backup/restore and bulk API operations. Dataproc templates offers scale through parallelism natively available with Apache Spark, simplicity of management/zero ops through Dataproc's Serverless Spark feature (with autoscaling by default) and speed to production with its simplicity - no code, just configuration.

There are a variety of generally available templates that integrate disparate systems. Learn more at: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/dataproc-templates
